## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
npm install
```

## Testing

Snapshot testing is done with Jest which ships with React, but you can run the following command if you don't have it for some reason.

```sh
npm install --save-dev jest babel-jest babel-preset-env babel-preset-react react-test-renderer
```

Assertion testing for components and containers is done with Enzyme.

```sh
npm install --save-dev enzyme
npm install --save-dev enzyme-adapter-react-16
```
